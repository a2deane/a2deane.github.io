    <font size=+2>ICS4U Culminating Project - Python "Database": <a href="https://github.com/a2deane/database_app">GitHub Repo</a>, <a href="/website/Blog Stuff/ICS4U-Proposal.pdf" download>Project Proposal</a></font> 
    <p>This was a fun project which took me approximately 2 months to complete. I've always loved working with data structures so I knew I wanted my final project to be a simple database.
         I originally wanted this to run on a browser since I was interested in computer networking and servers at the time, but it ultimately didn't work out due to time constraints.
         Most of the features, such as password "protection" and physically writing data to files, and the entire GUI system (via PySimpleGUI) were all tangential thoughts that compounded to make this huge project! 
         The only piece of code I didn't write was to fix a memory issue where the program wasn't aware that a file had been updated on runtime (thank you to my computer science teacher for this fix!). 
         If I recall correctly, I ended up getting 99% on this project since I went above and beyond the listed criteria on the rubric.</p>

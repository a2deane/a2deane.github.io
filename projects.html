    <font size=+2>ICS4U Culminating Project - Python "Database": <a href="https://github.com/a2deane/database_app" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>, <a href="https://a2deane.github.io/misc/ICS4U-Proposal.pdf" target="_blank">Project Proposal</a></font> 
    <p>This was a fun project which took me approximately 2 months to complete. I've always loved working with data structures so I knew I wanted my final project to be a simple database.
         I originally wanted this to run on a browser since I was interested in computer networking and servers at the time, but it ultimately didn't work out due to time constraints.
         Most of the features, such as password "protection", physically writing data to files, and the entire GUI system (via PySimpleGUI) were all tangential thoughts that compounded to make this project! 
         The only piece of code I didn't write was to fix a memory issue where the program wasn't aware that a file had been updated on runtime (thank you to my computer science teacher for this fix!). 
         This project taught me to set realistic goals for myself as well as self-sufficiency in troubleshooting code.

    <p>This website is hosted entirely for free with GitHub Pages. I started this website as a passion project in my first year of university, and I hope it grows with me during my academic journey. I have not used HTML before, so I am learning as I go!</p>
